--->Problem Statement
Millions of individuals face difficulty in securing and repaying small personal loans due to rigid banking systems and lack of income stability.
At the same time:

There is a shortage of accessible micro-employment opportunities for daily wage earners.

Urban and semi-urban residents regularly struggle to find reliable help for small tasks like electrical repairs, plumbing, or daily chores.

There is no integrated system that connects people in need of loans with micro-task opportunities that help them earn and repay those loans simultaneously, while also solving community problems.

---> Approach & Solution
 Our Approach:
We observed three core problems:

Difficulty in accessing and repaying loans

Lack of flexible, short-term earning opportunities

Daily-life service needs often go unmet (electricians, helpers, etc.)

We decided to solve all three through one unified platform.

 Our Solution:
SkillCredit is a platform that connects loan seekers with real-world tasks to repay their loans.

 Step-by-Step Flow:

A person applies for a small loan (max 2 active loans at a time)

Admin approves the loan with 8% simple interest

Community users post small service requests

Loan seekers complete those tasks (2–3 hours a day)

The value of completed tasks gets auto-deducted from their loan

Once one loan is cleared, they’re eligible for the next

 Key Outcomes:

Simplified, fair loan process

Real micro-employment generation

On-demand help for community members

Promotes financial discipline and local trust
